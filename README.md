Original Plan for the project 📝

1️⃣ Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number

2️⃣ Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number

3️⃣ Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight (🌟https://pokeapi.co/​)

4️⃣ Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent

5️⃣ Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight) 

6️⃣ Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins

☝🏼The program explains the rules of the game.
