Original Plan for the project

1.Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number

2.Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number

3.Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight (★https://pokeapi.co/​)

4.Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent

5.Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight) 

6.Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins

The program explains the rules of the game.
